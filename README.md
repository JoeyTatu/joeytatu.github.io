# TVBridge Prototype Website

This project was developed as part of the **Web Design module** in the **Higher Diploma in Computing (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning)** at the **National College of Ireland**.  
**Programme Code:** HDAIML_SEP25OL

TVBridge, a company specialising in digital media and television services, commissioned the development of a modern, fully functional prototype website to support the launch of its upcoming online TV scheduling platform. The platform is designed to simplify viewer access to live and upcoming television listings in an efficient and intuitive manner.

## Project Overview

With growing demand for streamlined access to television scheduling information, TVBridge identified an opportunity to improve upon existing online services by delivering a more responsive, visually engaging, and technically scalable platform.  

Founded in 2021 by a team of media technology specialists, TVBridge initially focused on consultancy services supporting broadcasters in digital transformation. In 2023, the company began development of its scheduling platform using Sky UK and Sky Ireland channels as the initial implementation model, demonstrating how the system could support multiple broadcasters while remaining scalable for future expansion.

## Website Structure

The prototype website includes the following pages:  

- **Homepage**: Introduces the service, engages users, and encourages navigation through the site.  
- **About Page**: Provides insight into TVBridge’s mission, values, and future development goals.  
- **Contact Page**: Allows viewers, clients, and partners to make enquiries or request further information.  
- **TV Guide Page**: Central feature of the platform, providing organised listings for each channel with EPG numbers, official logos, channel names, and programme schedules for the next seven days. Includes a search function for quick access to specific channels or programmes.

## Features

- Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.  
- Scalable structure to support additional channels and networks in future phases.  
- Search functionality for channels and programmes.  
- Clean, intuitive layout with modern styling and usability-focused design.  
- Modular architecture to allow future enhancements and content integration.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structural clarity and semantic markup.  
- **CSS3** – Responsive styling and visual design.  
- **JavaScript** – Client-side interactivity and dynamic features.  

The website was developed with industry best practices in mind, including performance optimisation, usability compliance, and mobile-first design principles.
