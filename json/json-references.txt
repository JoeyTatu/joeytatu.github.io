JSON References:

1. custom-images.json
   - Stores direct URL references for custom images keyed by show names.
     Structure: JSON object with string keys (show names) and string values (image URLs).
     Example: "Big Brother": "https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/589/1474564.jpg"

2. pattern-mapping.json
   - Maps regex patterns to image URLs for dynamic image assignment based on show names.
     Structure: JSON array of objects with keys: pattern (string), flags (string), url (string).
     Example:
     {
         "pattern": "^STV News",
         "flags": "i",
         "url": "https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/111/279632.jpg"
     }
     Notes: 
       * pattern uses regex syntax to match show names.
       * flags modify regex behavior (e.g., "i" for case-insensitive).
       * url points to an image (local or external).

3. Usage Notes
   - custom-images.json: for static mappings of known shows to images.
   - pattern-mapping.json: for dynamic or partial name matches.
   - Both can be loaded in JavaScript using fetch() or imported as modules.
     Example:
     fetch('custom-images.json')
       .then(response => response.json())
       .then(data => console.log(data["Big Brother"]));
